RMD Template
============

This is just basic Rails Template I made for myself. Rails 4, Mongoid 4, Devise and Unicorn pre-configured. Ready to push to Heroku. `mongoid.yml` is configured to use with Heroku's MongoHQ Addon.

Just do a mass-search-and-replace for **RmdTemplate** with whatever your app name is, and you're good to go.

There might have been better ways do this, but I'm just too lazy to search for / learn them.
